History of Shri Pak Goti Adariyan Saheb, Surat

The Shri Pak Goti Adariyan Saheb is among the oldest and most venerated Zoroastrian fire temples in Surat, Gujarat. Deeply rooted in the city’s Parsi history, it is regarded as a sacred landmark of great antiquity—believed to be around 600–700 years old. The first recorded reference to the Adariyan dates to 1796 CE, though its origins are believed to go much further back, supported by oral traditions and community lore.

When the Parsis settled along Gujarat’s western coast after migrating from Iran, they gradually established fire temples—first Dadgahs, then Adariyans and Atash Behrams—to preserve their religious rituals. In Surat, before other temples were established, the Goti Adariyan served as the center for Pavmahal Kriyas (major sacred rituals) and purification ceremonies. It has long been considered the spiritual pride of the Parsis of Surat.

Possible Origins of the Name and Fire

While the true origin of the Goti Adariyan remains uncertain, three major accounts are associated with its establishment:

The Mobed from Khambhat Theory
Some scholars suggest that a Mobed from Khambhat (Cambay) named or surnamed “Goti” may have founded the Adariyan for performing essential Pavmahal rituals. Much like the ancient Daremeher at Navsari (established around 1142 CE), this could have started as a Dadgah fire, later elevated to the status of an Adariyan through consecration ceremonies. This aligns with the historical period when Parsis began establishing communal places of worship instead of keeping only household fires.

The Miraculous Fireball Legend
According to a popular legend recorded by Shri Roni Khurshedchaher Khan, a “ball of fire” appeared miraculously in a field during heavy rains. Despite the downpour, the fire remained undoused. Locals, recognizing the Parsis’ reverence for fire, informed their leaders, who brought Mobeds to perform the rituals and consecrate the flame. The fire’s spherical shape gave rise to the name “Goti,” meaning “sphere” or “ball.”

The Meteorite Interpretation
Religious scholar Shri Rohinbhai Noshirwan Karanjia proposed that the “ball of fire” could have been a small meteorite that fell near the village of Tunki, close to the Tapi River. He interpreted this as an act of divine will—Pak Dadar Ahura Mazda choosing that sacred site for the Adariyan. Situated on the banks of the ancient Tapi, the location’s sanctity echoes the city’s older name, Suryapur, and its association with Khorshed Yazad, the Sun deity.

Over time, the Goti Adariyan has always remained near the Tapi River—first at Rafi Buraj and later rebuilt slightly inland after floods. Despite being near the riverbed and repeatedly affected by floods, the sacred fire has never been extinguished, strengthening the community’s faith in its divine protection. Non-Parsi residents in the area have also long believed the Adariyan safeguards them from natural disasters.

Legacy and Stewardship

Throughout its history, the Goti Adariyan has been repaired and maintained approximately every 20–25 years, reflecting the devotion of Surat’s Parsi community. The temple’s trustees have included respected families such as the Modi, Wadia, Palia, Bhacca, and Dotivala families.

The Turel family (originally known as “Velati”) has served as the Panthakis (priests and caretakers) of the Adariyan for seven generations. Their dedication—especially during floods, when they protected and relocated the sacred fire to safety—has been recorded with reverence. The family’s lineage of priests, including Ervad Rustamji, Ervad Jamasji, Ervad Jamshedji, and their descendants, continues this spiritual service to the present day.

A Symbol of Faith and Continuity

The Shri Pak Goti Adariyan Saheb stands as a testament to Surat’s deep Parsi heritage—an enduring symbol of devotion, resilience, and divine protection. Despite the passage of centuries and the trials of nature, the sacred fire continues to burn bright on the banks of the Tapi, uniting generations in faith.
